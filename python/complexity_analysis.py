"""
Algoritm problem and solving techniques and complexity analysis

* Brute Force the solution - (generally by traversing all the loops and checking all options), 
the brute force solutions is also useful as a initial "raw reference" when testign other designs

* Visualize the problem - Test on examples - Find the Special Cases - collaterals ? serial process ?

* Sort? / Halt? / Parallel ? / check for usage of common algorithms optimizations patterns
